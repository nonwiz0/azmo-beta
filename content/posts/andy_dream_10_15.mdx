## Should we ignore depression?



Do you ever feel depressed? What is depression? According to World Health Organization (2021), “Depression is a common mental disorder”. The word ‘common’ is similar to words like ordinary, regular, frequent, or universal. Therefore, does that mean we can ignore those who feel depressed?  &#x20;



About 280 million people in the world have depression. (WHO, 2021). WHO (2021) estimated 3.8% of the population was affected with depression this included 5.0% adults and 5.7 adults older than 60 years. Again, the question was should we ignore depression?  &#x20;
