## Should we ignore depression?

Do you ever feel depressed? What is depression? According to World Health Organization (2021), “Depression is a common mental disorder”. The word ‘common’ is similar to words like ordinary, regular, frequent, or universal. Therefore, does that mean we can ignore those who feel depressed?   

About 280 million people in the world have depression. (WHO, 2021). WHO (2021) estimated 3.8% of the population was affected with depression this included 5.0% adults and 5.7 adults older than 60 years. Again, the question was should we ignore depression?

    - Having problem with sleep  
    - Changes in appetite or weight

**What are the factors?**  

According to WHO (2021), depression can be the result of having complex interaction of social, losing a job, traumatic events. It can be because a person got bullied by other people, losing his or her job, or depression can just occur suddenly.   

**How can we prevent it?**  

WHO (2021) has made a lot of prevention programs to reduce depression including school-based programs on how to enhance a pattern of positive coping in children and adolescents?

Above all, there are magic words that can help us to be strong when we are dealing with depression.   

Our heavenly Fathers have promised us when you are depressed:  

> “It is the LORD who goes before you. He will be with you; He will not leave you or forsake you. Do not fear or dismayed” – Deuteronomy 31:8  

> “The LORD is near to the broken-hearted and saves the crushed in spirit” – Psalm 34:18  

> “Sing for joy, o heaven and exalt o earth; break forth, o mountains, into singing! For the LORD has comforted his people and will have compassion on his afflicted. But Zion said: The LORD has forsaken me; my Lord has forgotten me. Can a woman forget her nursing child, that she should have no compassion on the son of her womb? Even these may forget, yet I will not forget you” – Isaiah 49:13-15  

> “Hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy spirit Who has been given to us” – Romans 5:5  

In conclusion, to answer our question “Should we ignore depression?” The answer is not. Not only is depression able to lead us to sickness or even suicide, but The LORD gives us a clear answer that we should ignore depression and share the words of love to everyone.
